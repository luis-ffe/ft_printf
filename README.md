## ft_printf

Your own overcomplicated version of printf from `#include <stdio.h>`.

Summary:
"The goal of this project is pretty straightforward. You will recode printf().
You will mainly learn about using a variable number of arguments. How cool is that?? It is actually pretty cool :) "


• `%c` Prints a single character. \
• `%s` Prints a string (as defined by the common C convention). \
• `%p` The void * pointer argument has to be printed in hexadecimal format. \
• `%d` Prints a decimal (base 10) number.
• `%i` Prints an integer in base 10. \
• `%u` Prints an unsigned decimal (base 10) number. \
• `%x` Prints a number in hexadecimal (base 16) lowercase format. \
• `%X` Prints a number in hexadecimal (base 16) uppercase format. \
• `%%` Prints a percent sign.

## Tips
Try not to overdo it like i did, itoa and atoi arent needed at all and neither are the Mallocs and frees. Just try using write and avoid memory allocation.

## To do:

Comment each function use and functionality to keep the code clean and accessible to everyone and following the "good practices".
